## Notes

This Work Day Scheduler was built using jQuery, Bootstrap and Font Awesome. I found the localStorage part to be particularly challenging, but I was able to get help from my tutor and many study groups. I had to console.log many different items along the way to ensure each piece was working before moving on to the next function.
